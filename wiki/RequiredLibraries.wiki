#Discussion of what needs to be installed to get going with camleon

In addition to the standard OCaml distribution, camleon needs:

  # OCaml bindings for the fftw library: http://math.umh.ac.be/an/software.php
  # OCaml OpenGL bindings (lablglut): http://redwood.ucdavis.edu/~issac/software/

= FFTW =

The OCaml bindings for fftw -- the fast fourier transform library -- currently work with fftw version 2. A version for fftw3 is in the works, but camleon currently works with the old version 2.

You'll need the fftw headers package for your distro (probably fftw-dev or fftw-devel) to compile the ocaml bindings.

=== SUSE notes ===

In the ocaml fftw Makefile, change:

{{{OCAMLH=$(shell ocamlc -where)/caml}}}

to:

{{{OCAMLH=$(shell ocamlc -where)}}}

And change:

{{{INCLUDE_FFTW = /usr/include/fftw}}}

to:

{{{INCLUDE_FFTW = /usr/include/}}}
